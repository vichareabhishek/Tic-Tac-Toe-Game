Tic Tac Toe against Computer

This is a Clinet Serve Tic-Tac-Toe game using socket programming 
In this game Clinet plays against computer(Server)<br/>
Client symbol's is "O" and Server play with "X" 
Client plays first.
Client has to input two numbers(Row Column)for the place were he wants to play
Eg if client enters 1 3 the "O" will be place at row 1 column 3. Then the Server plays and the game goes on.The game is terminated when there is a result.</br>

To Run the progrom download Client.java, Server.java and .java files under one project. Then run the programs client's console will ask you to play your first move then at the Server's console server will play his first move which will be displayed at Client's console and thus the game will continue.</br>
